# SolarPowerForecasting
Solgen, an Indiana based solar power generation company, is consulting us for their power generation optimization.
They want to understand the impact of cloud cover on their new power generation project.
The goal of the business is to see if this prototype is worth implementing on a larger scale.
We have been provided the weekly data of their kW power generation and cloud coverage from October 2014 to July 2015.
